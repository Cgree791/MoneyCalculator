Money Calculator that saves on refresh (WIP)
This website comes in helpful when you need to find out how much
money you have but only know the amount of quarters,nickles,dimes, ect... you have 
you just put it into the proper spots and press Calculate
and BOOM it shows you the total amount of money you have!
All you need to know is how many you have!

(WIP FEEDBACK) V3
Added a auto updating count for each set of money so you can see it update live, and they calculate total to add them all together, fixed some small bugs of money, and light look difference
