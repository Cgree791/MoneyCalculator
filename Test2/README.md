Money Calculator that saves on refresh (WIP)
This website comes in helpful when you need to find out how much
money you have but only know the amount of quarters,nickles,dimes, ect... you have 
you just put it into the proper spots and press Calculate
and BOOM it shows you the total amount of money you have!
All you need to know is how many you have!

(WIP FEEDBACK) V2
Currently the history just updates on refresh of the main page causing the total to repeat many times
